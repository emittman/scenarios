Dirichlet Process Mixture Model for High Dimensional Gene Expression Data

High-throughput sequencing technologies such as RNA-sequencing and microarrays allow researchers to measure a single sample's expression of tens of thousands of genes. In experiments, estimation of treatment effects presents a serious multiple testing problem. Empirical Bayes approaches provide regularization to parameter estimates, but the quality of these will be limited by restrictive assumptions put on the prior distribution for these parameters. To remedy this, we propose a fully Bayesian analysis that puts a Dirichlet Process prior on the distribution of gene specific parameters in order to automatically learn the underlying distribution of gene specific parameters as a way of effectively pooling information across genes. To make this practically feasible, we implement a Blocked Gibbs sampler exploiting general purpose programming for a GPU, as much of the computation for this sampler is embarassingly parallel.
